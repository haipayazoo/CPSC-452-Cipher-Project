## Language Used: Python 3

## Usage
Run `./cipher.py --help` for the full usage.

## Extra Credit
We implemented the Hill Cipher for the extra credit.

## Additional Notes
As stated in the usage, run ./cipher.py --help for the proper format on how to run it, though the format of running the program with the proper cipher is in the same format presented in the instructions.
